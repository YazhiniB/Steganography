# Steganography

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. 

Project Description:
This project combines of Python, GUI and Tkinter. In this Project we gonna hide messages into an image and decrypt back to its original form. First we need to choose an image from the File Explorer Or any other sources we wish. Make sure that the file you are choosing should be either in png/jpg or .txt format. After choosing the desired picture, write the message you want to hide. After writing the required message, click "Save Image". Then the image will be saved in the same location as, "Imghidden.jpg". Now for the decryption process, click the "Imghidden.jpg" file and select decrypt option and it will display the message hidden in the selected image.

Libraries Used:
PIL
Stegano
OS
Filedialog
ImageTk

Purpose:
Confidential communication: Steganography can be used to send confidential messages without raising suspicion, unlike encryption, which can be detected by sophisticated security systems.

Copyright protection: Steganography can be used to embed copyright information within digital media to protect it from unauthorized use.

Covert operations: Steganography can be used by intelligence agencies to transmit secret messages without raising suspicion.

Digital forensics: Steganography can be used by law enforcement agencies to detect and recover hidden data from suspects' devices.

Watermarking: Steganography can be used to embed a digital watermark within an image, video, or audio file to protect against unauthorized use or copyright infringement.

Overall, the purpose of steganography is to provide a secure and stealthy method of transmitting information, while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
